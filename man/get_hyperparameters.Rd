\title{Get Pre-tuned Model Hyperparameters}
\usage{
get_hyperparameters(model = "quali", timing = "early")
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A character string specifying the type of prediction model.
Valid options are:
\itemize{
  \item `"quali"`: For qualifying prediction models (pole position and final position).
  \item `"results"`: For race result prediction models (win, podium, top 10, finish status, and final position).
}}

\item{timing}{A character string indicating the timing of the prediction
within a race weekend. This determines which set of features were
available for tuning. Valid options depend on `model`:
\itemize{
  \item If `model = 'quali'`: `"early"` or `"late"`.
  \item If `model = 'results'`: `"early"`, `"late"`, or `"after-quali"`.
}}
}
\value{
A named list. Each name corresponds to a specific prediction task
  (e.g., `pole_hyperparameters`, `position_hyperparameters`), and each value
  is another named list where keys are the `parsnip` engine (e.g., 'glmnet',
  'ranger') and values are the corresponding optimal hyperparameters.
}
\description{
Retrieves a list of pre-tuned hyperparameters for various model types and
prediction scenarios. These hyperparameters were determined through a tuning
process in September 2025 and are hard-coded into this function for
convenience and reproducibility.

This function is a helper to avoid re-running computationally expensive
tuning grids when training ensemble models.
