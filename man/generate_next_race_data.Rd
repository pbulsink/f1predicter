\title{Generate Prediction Data for the Next Race}
\usage{
generate_next_race_data(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to `generate_new_data()`, such
as `drivers` or `historical_data`.}
}
\value{
A tibble where each row corresponds to a driver for the next
  upcoming race, and columns are the features required for the modeling
  functions.
}
\description{
A wrapper around `generate_new_data()` that automatically finds the next
upcoming race from the `f1predicter::schedule` data and generates the
corresponding feature set.
}
\details{
This function identifies the next race by finding the first entry in the
`f1predicter::schedule` with a date greater than or equal to the current
system date. It then extracts the `season` and `round` for that race and
passes them to `generate_new_data()`.

A message is printed to the console indicating which race (`season`, `round`,
and `race_name`) the data is being generated for.
