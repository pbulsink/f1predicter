\title{Train Race Result Models (Pre-Practice)}
\usage{
model_results_early(data = clean_data(), engine = "xgboost")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the modeling data. Defaults to `clean_data()`.}

\item{engine}{A character string specifying the model engine. One of "xgboost"
(default) or "glmnet".}
}
\value{
A list containing five fitted `workflow` objects for `win`, `podium`,
  `t10`, `finish`, and `position`.
}
\description{
This function trains a suite of five classification models to predict race
results using data available *before* any practice or qualifying sessions
have occurred for a race weekend.

It produces the same models as `model_results_after_quali`, but uses a
smaller set of predictors.
}
\details{
The function filters data for seasons from 2018 onwards. All five models are
built using the `xgboost` engine, with hyperparameters tuned via a Latin
hypercube grid search.

The four binary models (`win`, `podium`, `t10`, `finish`) are optimized on
the `mn_log_loss` metric. The `position` regression model is optimized
based on the `rmse` (Root Mean Squared Error) metric.
