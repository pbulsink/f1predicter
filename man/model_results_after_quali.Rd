\title{Train Race Result Models (Post-Qualifying)}
\usage{
model_results_after_quali(data = clean_data(), engine = "xgboost")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the modeling data. Defaults to `clean_data()`.}

\item{engine}{A character string specifying the model engine. One of "xgboost"
(default) or "glmnet".}
}
\value{
A list containing five fitted `workflow` objects for `win`, `podium`,
  `t10`, `finish`, and `position`.
}
\description{
This function trains a suite of five classification models to predict race
results using data available *after* qualifying has completed. This includes
historical data, practice session metrics, and final qualifying results.

The function produces:
1. `win`: A binary classification model to predict if a driver will win the race.
2. `podium`: A binary classification model to predict if a driver will finish in the top 3.
3. `t10`: A binary classification model to predict if a driver will finish in the top 10.
4. `finish`: A binary classification model to predict if a driver will finish the race (not DNF).
5. `position`: A regression model to predict a driver's exact finishing position.
}
\details{
The function filters data for seasons from 2018 onwards. All five models are
built using the `xgboost` engine, with hyperparameters tuned via a Latin
hypercube grid search.

The four binary models (`win`, `podium`, `t10`, `finish`) are optimized on
the `mn_log_loss` metric. The `position` regression model is optimized
based on the `rmse` (Root Mean Squared Error) metric.
