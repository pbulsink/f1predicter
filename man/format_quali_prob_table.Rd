\title{Format Qualifying Probabilities as a Table}
\usage{
format_quali_prob_table(predictions)
}
\arguments{
\item{predictions}{A data frame of predictions from `predict_quali_round()`.
This must contain the `.probs` list-column with position probabilities.}
}
\value{
A `gt_tbl` object.
}
\description{
This function takes the results from `predict_quali_round()` and creates a
`gt` table visualizing the probability of each driver achieving each
qualifying position.
}
\details{
The table is formatted with a color heatmap, where darker/more colorful
cells indicate a higher probability. It requires the `gt` package to be
installed. The function returns a `gt` object which can be printed or saved
using `gt::gtsave()`.
}
