\title{Predict Race Results for a Round}
\usage{
predict_round(new_data = generate_next_race_data(), results_models = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{new_data}{A data frame of new data, typically from `generate_new_data()`.}

\item{results_models}{A list of fitted `workflow` objects for race results prediction.
If `NULL` (default), the function will attempt to load the "early" results
models using `load_models()`. Otherwise, it should be a list as returned by
a `model_results_*()` function, containing `win`, `podium`, `t10`, `finish`,
and `position`.}
}
\value{
A tibble with predictions for all race outcomes for each driver,
  including win/podium/t10/finish odds and the likely finishing position.
}
\description{
A wrapper function to predict all race outcomes for a given round.
}
\details{
This function combines the outputs of `predict_winner()`, `predict_podium()`,
`predict_t10()`, `predict_finish()`, and `predict_position()` into a single
tibble. It requires the full suite of models trained by one of the
`model_results_*()` functions.
