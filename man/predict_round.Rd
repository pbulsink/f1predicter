\title{Predict Race Results for a Round}
\usage{
predict_round(
  new_data = generate_new_data(),
  win_model,
  podium_model,
  t10_model,
  finish_model,
  position_model
)
}
\arguments{
\item{new_data}{A data frame of new data, typically from `generate_new_data()`.}

\item{win_model}{A `workflow` object for predicting the winner.}

\item{podium_model}{A `workflow` object for predicting a podium finish.}

\item{t10_model}{A `workflow` object for predicting a top 10 finish.}

\item{finish_model}{A `workflow` object for predicting finishing the race.}

\item{position_model}{A `workflow` object for predicting the finishing position.}
}
\value{
A tibble with predictions for all race outcomes for each driver,
  including win/podium/t10/finish odds and the likely finishing position.
}
\description{
A wrapper function to predict all race outcomes for a given round.
}
\details{
This function combines the outputs of `predict_winner()`, `predict_podium()`,
`predict_t10()`, `predict_finish()`, and `predict_position()` into a single
tibble. It requires the full suite of models trained by one of the
`model_results_*()` functions.
